# MB_001_HeroRPG
## Time Taken to Complete the Exercise
- 6 days

## Challenges I Faced
- Working with character animations was difficult because they were generic. I prefer humanoid animations for ease of use when adding avatar masks, IK, curves, etc.
- Finding suitable UI sprites that matched the theme.
- Sourcing appropriate SFX for both gameplay and UI.

## Areas for Improvement
- **AudioManager Script:** I could make it more general.
- **VFX Management:** I could implement a pooling system for better performance.
- **Game Design:** I could further tweak values to improve the game feel.
- **Enemy Spawning:** I could make the system more sophisticated, with waves and better control over the spawn rate.

## Potential Enhancements
- Add more enemy types and bosses.
- Introduce a map or compass to locate enemies and drop boxes.
- Add more weapons.
- Implement special attacks for the hero.
- Introduce an experience system allowing the player to level up.
- Add stat upgrades (e.g., max HP, damage, movement speed, attack speed, etc.) upon leveling up.
- Add a health drop box so the player can heal.
- Include more collectibles with various purposes (e.g., diamonds, crystals, coins, etc.).
- Possibly add a shop and more skins.
- Consider adding more levels.
